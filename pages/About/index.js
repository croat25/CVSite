                <br />
                <p>I am Bruno Salapic, I specalize in automation and all testing of large scale software products. I am a big fan of football(soccer) as well as a Joga Bonito fan.
                    I have a passion for Tiramisu because as most know Tiramisu is by far the best dessert in the world. Nothing tops it. I also play alot of video games on my spare time 
                    and as well tutor subjects for anything related to programming whether it be University of College courses. Of course my tutoring is free of charge.

                    I love to travel and my favorite destination is Croatia(Hrvatska). I have been to other countries such as the United States of America, Bosnia, Serbia, Germany, Austria,
                     Netherlands, Spain, Hungary, Switzerland, France, and Italy. Being able to see the world and cultures of different parts of the world is an amazing experience and understanding
                     why certain areas of the world are the way they are. Along with that I also enjoy reading alot about history itself, more so related to economics, warfare, and such. Im not to 
                     interested in what people were wearing in certain parts in the timeline but more so the situation at the time.
